# This is a dummy deployment script for Credit Core to AWS S3 and CloudFront.
# It demonstrates the AWS CLI commands that would be used for deployment.
# This script will NOT actually deploy anything without proper AWS configuration and credentials.

# --- Configuration Variables (replace with your actual values) ---
S3_BUCKET_NAME="your-credit-core-s3-bucket-name" # e.g., creditcore.com
CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID="your-cloudfront-distribution-id" # e.g., E1234567890ABC
AWS_REGION="your-aws-region" # e.g., us-east-1

# --- Deployment Steps ---

echo "Starting dummy AWS deployment for Credit Core..."

echo "1. Syncing website files to S3 bucket: s3://${S3_BUCKET_NAME}"
# aws s3 sync . s3://${S3_BUCKET_NAME} --delete --region ${AWS_REGION}
echo "(Dummy command: aws s3 sync . s3://${S3_BUCKET_NAME} --delete --region ${AWS_REGION})"

echo "2. Invalidating CloudFront cache for distribution: ${CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID}"
# aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id ${CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID} --paths "/*" --region ${AWS_REGION}
echo "(Dummy command: aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id ${CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID} --paths \"/*\" --region ${AWS_REGION})"

echo "Dummy AWS deployment script finished. No actual deployment performed."

# --- Next Steps (for a real deployment) ---
# 1. Ensure you have AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials.
# 2. Replace placeholder variables (S3_BUCKET_NAME, CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID, AWS_REGION).
# 3. Uncomment the 'aws' commands to enable actual deployment.
# 4. Make the script executable: chmod +x deploy_to_aws.sh
# 5. Run the script: ./deploy_to_aws.sh
