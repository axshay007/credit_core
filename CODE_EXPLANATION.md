# Credit Core - Code Explanation and Workflow

This document provides a concise overview of the `Credit Core` project, its architecture, core functionalities, and development workflow. It is a frontend-only financial assistant website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 1. Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure:

```
credit_core/
├── css/
│   └── styles.css         # Global and component styles
├── js/
│   ├── advisor.js         # AI-Powered Credit Advisor logic
│   ├── comparison.js      # Credit Card Comparison Engine logic
│   ├── dashboard.js       # Credit Health Dashboard logic
│   ├── education.js       # Educational Resources logic
│   ├── main.js            # Main JavaScript for global functionalities
│   └── tools.js           # Financial Tools logic
├── images/                # Placeholder for images
├── data/                  # Placeholder for data files
├── index.html             # Main entry point
├── README.md              # Project overview
├── CODE_EXPLANATION.md    # This document
└── todo.md                # Task tracking
```

## 2. Core Technologies

-   **HTML5**: Structures web content.
-   **CSS3**: Styles the design, including responsiveness and animations.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Implements all interactive functionalities, dynamic content, calculations, and local storage.

## 3. Key Functionalities (JavaScript Modules)

Each major feature of the website is encapsulated in its own JavaScript file for better organization and maintainability:

-   **`main.js`**: Handles global interactions, navigation, and general UI elements.
-   **`advisor.js`**: Manages the simulated AI credit advisor, including pre-built financial advice scenarios and interactive Q&A.
-   **`dashboard.js`**: Powers the credit health dashboard, including the credit score simulator, credit utilization gauge, and debt payoff calculator.
-   **`comparison.js`**: Implements the credit card comparison engine, allowing filtering, side-by-side comparisons, and 


recommendations.
-   **`tools.js`**: Contains logic for financial calculators, including interest (compound/simple), reward optimization, and payment timeline visualization.
-   **`education.js`**: Manages educational resources, such as animated concept explainers, the interactive credit journey map, and the glossary with 3D card flip animations.

## 4. Workflow

1.  **HTML Structure**: `index.html` defines the page layout and links CSS/JS files.
2.  **CSS Styling**: `styles.css` provides the visual design, ensuring responsiveness and an appealing user interface.
3.  **JavaScript Interactivity**: Each JavaScript module (`.js` files) adds specific functionalities, handling user input, calculations, and dynamic content updates.
4.  **Local Storage**: Used to persist user preferences and history for a personalized experience.

This modular approach allows for easier development, debugging, and future enhancements.
